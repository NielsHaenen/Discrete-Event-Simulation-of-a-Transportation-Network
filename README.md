# Discrete-Event-Simulation-of-a-Transportation-Network
Utilizing Python's discrete-event simulation capabilities to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a transportation network


The repository contains the necessary code for conducting a scientific analysis of the performance of a transportation network comprised of buses. Make sure that the appropriate versions of the required modules, as specified in the accompanying requirements.txt file, are installed prior to execution. 

Execution of the main.py script will generate the simulation results. The user can manipulate the number of buses in the network and subsequently observe the effect on performance through the modification of the main.py file. Feel free to modify other parameters values as well in the parameters.py file.
